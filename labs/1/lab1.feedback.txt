Michael,

About your programs...

Functionality

- Could not test functionality because programs cannot be compiled. Root cause
  seems to be the fact that the name of the file does not match the name of
  your class.  -1pt

Please make sure you read the problems well; follow instructions.


Style Check

- All programs are missing the header: -1pt
  /**
   * file: SinglyLinkedList.java
   * author: student name
   * course: CMPT 220
   * assignment: project 1
   * due date: August 30, 2003
   * version: 1.3
   * 
   * This file contains the declaration of the SinglyLinkedList abstract data
   * type.
   */

- You used tabs, which is forbidden. -1pt

- There is incorrect indentation. -1pt


About your essay:

- I could not open the file!



Peace,

- Dr. Rivas
